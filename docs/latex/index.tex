Vine copulas are a flexible class of dependence models consisting of bivariate building blocks (see e.\+g., \href{https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1083600/1083600.pdf}{\tt Aas et al., 2009}). You can find a comprehensive list of publications and other materials on \href{http://www.statistics.ma.tum.de/en/research/vine-copula-models/}{\tt vine-\/copula.\+org}.\hypertarget{index_what-vcl}{}\section{What is vinecopulib?}\label{index_what-vcl}
vinecopulib is a header-\/only C++ library for vine copula models based on \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\tt Eigen}. It provides high-\/performance implementations of the core features of the popular \href{https://github.com/tnagler/VineCopula}{\tt Vine\+Copula R library}, in particular inference algorithms for both vine copula and bivariate copula models. Advantages over Vine\+Copula are
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a stand-\/alone C++ library with interfaces to both R and Python,
\item a sleaker and more modern A\+PI,
\item shorter runtimes and lower memory consumption, especially in high dimensions,
\item nonparametric and multi-\/parameter families.

Version \href{https://github.com/vinecopulib/vinecopulib/releases}{\tt 0.\+3.\+1} was released on April 5, 2019. While we did our best to design a user-\/friendly A\+PI, the library is still under active development and changes are to be expected. We are also working on interfaces for \href{https://github.com/vinecopulib/rvinecopulib}{\tt R} and \href{https://github.com/vinecopulib/pyvinecopulib}{\tt Python}.\hypertarget{index_Contact}{}\section{Contact}\label{index_Contact}
