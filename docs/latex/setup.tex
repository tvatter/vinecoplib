To build the library, you\textquotesingle{}ll need at minimum\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C.2B.2B_compilers}{\tt a C++11-\/compatible compiler} (tested with G\+CC 6.\+3.\+0 and Clang 3.\+5.\+0 on Linux and Apple\+Clang 8.\+0.\+0 on O\+SX)
\item \href{https://cmake.org/}{\tt C\+Make 3.\+2 (or later)}
\item \href{http://www.boost.org/}{\tt Boost 1.\+56 (or later)}
\item \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\tt Eigen 3.\+3 (or later)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Optionally, you\textquotesingle{}ll need\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}{\tt Doxygen} and \href{https://www.graphviz.org/}{\tt graphviz} (to build the documentations)
\item \href{https://www.r-project.org/about.html}{\tt R} and \href{https://github.com/tnagler/VineCopula}{\tt Vine\+Copula} (to run the unit tests)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread}{\tt C++11 thread support library}, available along with any C++11 compiler on O\+S\+X/\+Windows/most-\/linux-\/distributions, is used for multithreading.
\item A {\ttfamily find\+R.\+cmake} looks for R and Vine\+Copula in the default locations for linux and osx, but problems might occur with versions installed from R/\+R\+Studio. Therefore, prior to building the library, it is recommended to use\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo Rscript -e \textcolor{stringliteral}{'install.packages(c("VineCopula"), lib="/usr/lib/R/library",}
\textcolor{stringliteral}{repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")'}
\end{DoxyCode}

By default, vinecopulib is header-\/only. It means that we use the C\+Make build system, but only to build the documentation and unit-\/tests, and to automate installation (i.\+e., place headers in the usual location). If you just want to use vinecopulib, you can use the header files (located in the{\ttfamily includes}folder) right away.

The unix one liner (from the root folder)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && make doc &&
sudo make install && bin/test\_all
\end{DoxyCode}


Alternatively, we provide an option to precompile compiled the library in order to save building time (and memory) via the C\+Make option {\ttfamily V\+I\+N\+E\+C\+O\+P\+U\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+IB}. In this case, source files are generated from header files and the C\+Make build system additionally allows to install the .dylib/.so/.dll object.

The unix one liner (from the root folder)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DVINECOPULIB\_SHARED\_LIB=ON && make &&
make doc && sudo make install && bin/test\_all
\end{DoxyCode}

\hypertarget{setup_install-lib}{}\section{How to install the library}\label{setup_install-lib}
To install the library without unit tests, the {\ttfamily Make\+File} can be created via {\ttfamily cmake .. -\/\+D\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+NG=O\+FF}. Additionally, a {\ttfamily Debug} mode is available via {\ttfamily cmake .. -\/\+D\+C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+T\+Y\+PE=Debug}; to enable strict compiler warnings, use {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+S\+T\+R\+I\+C\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+I\+L\+ER=ON}. Finally, note that using {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+E\+X\+P\+O\+R\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+I\+L\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+M\+A\+N\+DS=ON} is useful if one is interested in using autocomplete or linting when working with the library.

On Windows, C\+Make will generate Visual Studio files instead of Makefiles, the following sequence of commands can be used to perform compilation using the command prompt\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
md build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Debug
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
\end{DoxyCode}
 Instead of the {\ttfamily cmake -\/-\/build} commands, the generated {\ttfamily vinecopulib.\+sln} file can be open in the Visual Studio G\+UI. Furthermore, as for linux systems, the third line can be replaced by {\ttfamily cmake .. -\/\+D\+V\+I\+N\+E\+C\+O\+P\+U\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+IB=ON} to generate the source files in order to compile vinecopulib in non-\/header-\/only mode.

The following C\+Make flags (given with example values) will likely come handy\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
-DBOOST\_ROOT=c:\(\backslash\)local\(\backslash\)boost\_1\_63\_0
-DEIGEN3\_INCLUDE\_DIR=c:\(\backslash\)local\(\backslash\)eigen-eigen-da9b4e14c255
-DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=c:\(\backslash\)local\(\backslash\)vinecopulib-install
-DCMAKE\_GENERATOR\_PLATFORM=x64
-DBOOST\_DEBUG=1
\end{DoxyCode}

\hypertarget{setup_include-headers}{}\subsection{As a header only library}\label{setup_include-headers}
The library can be included header only by simply copying the files in your project.\hypertarget{setup_include-install}{}\subsection{Using a system install}\label{setup_include-install}
Using {\ttfamily make install}, vinecopulib is installed in the usual location of the system, namely


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily $<$prefix$>$/include/} (for the headers),
\item {\ttfamily $<$prefix$>$/lib/} (for the shared library when {\ttfamily V\+I\+N\+E\+C\+O\+P\+U\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+IB=ON} is used),
\item {\ttfamily $<$prefix$>$/lib/cmake/vinecopulib} (to allow cmake to find the library with {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package}),
\end{DoxyItemize}

where {\ttfamily $<$prefix$>$} is e.\+g. {\ttfamily /usr/} or {\ttfamily /usr/local}. Note that {\ttfamily make install} only copies {\ttfamily \hyperlink{vinecopulib_8hpp_source}{vinecopulib.\+hpp}} in {\ttfamily $<$prefix$>$/include/} and puts the other headers in a subfolder {\ttfamily $<$prefix$>$/include/vinecopulib}, but using {\ttfamily \#include $<$\hyperlink{vinecopulib_8hpp_source}{vinecopulib.\+hpp}$>$} is enough to load both bivariate and vine functions.\hypertarget{setup_include-cmake}{}\subsection{In a C\+Make project}\label{setup_include-cmake}
The easiest way to include vinecopulib in another project (and to avoid writing makefiles) is to use C\+Make. For instance, an example projet where the source code to be linked could contain
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} file for the project\textquotesingle{}s setup,
\item a subfolder {\ttfamily src} for the source code, containing
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the source code,
\item another {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} file for the project libraries and executables.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The top-\/level {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} could be\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
cmake\_minimum\_required(VERSION 3.2)

set(CMAKE\_CXX\_STANDARD 11)

project (Example)

# Setting default folders
set(CMAKE\_RUNTIME\_OUTPUT\_DIRECTORY $\{CMAKE\_SOURCE\_DIR\}/bin)

# C++ compile flags
if (NOT WIN32)
 set(CMAKE\_CXX\_FLAGS "-std=gnu++11 -Wextra -Wall -Wno-delete-non-virtual-dtor -Werror=return-type -O2
       -DNDEBUG")
endif()

# Find vinecopulib package and dependencies
find\_package(vinecopulib                  REQUIRED)
find\_package(Boost 1.56                   REQUIRED)
include(cmake/findEigen3.cmake            REQUIRED)
find\_package(Threads                      REQUIRED)

# Set required variables for includes and libraries
# In the second line
#   * VINECOPULIB\_LIBRARIES is needed if vinecopulib has been built as a
#     shared lib (does nothing otherwise).
#   * CMAKE\_THREAD\_LIBS\_INIT is needed for some linux systems
#     (but does nothing on OSX/Windows).
set(external\_includes $\{VINECOPULIB\_INCLUDE\_DIR\} $\{EIGEN3\_INCLUDE\_DIR\} $\{Boost\_INCLUDE\_DIRS\})
set(external\_libs $\{VINECOPULIB\_LIBRARIES\} $\{CMAKE\_THREAD\_LIBS\_INIT\})

# Include subdirectory with project sources
add\_subdirectory(src)
\end{DoxyCode}


Assuming a single {\ttfamily main.\+cpp} source file (with {\ttfamily \#include $<$\hyperlink{vinecopulib_8hpp_source}{vinecopulib.\+hpp}$>$} at the top), the {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} file in {\ttfamily /src/} could then be\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
# Include header files
include\_directories($\{external\_includes\})

# Add main executable
add\_executable(main main.cpp)

# Link to vinecopulib if vinecopulib has been built as a shared lib
# and to pthreads on some linux systems (does nothing otherwise)
target\_link\_libraries(main $\{VINECOPULIB\_LIBRARIES\} $\{CMAKE\_THREAD\_LIBS\_INIT\})
\end{DoxyCode}
